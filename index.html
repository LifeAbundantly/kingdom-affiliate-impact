            <h3>Phased Growth Goals</h3>
            <h4>Phase 1: Building the Foundation</h4>
            <p>
                Our first phase focuses on establishing the program’s foundation by mobilizing 1,000 members within the first 30 days. 
                These members will become Kingdom partners and foundational stewards, aligning their giving with God’s Kingdom vision.
            </p>

            <h4>Phase 2: Expanding Outreach</h4>
            <p>
                By month six, the program will aim for a 6x increase in members, fueled by Holy Spirit guidance and the program’s growth through a powerful network of referrals. 
                This phase focuses on community building and establishing trust through testimonies and visible Kingdom impact.
            </p>

            <h4>Phase 3: Multiplying Generosity</h4>
            <p>
                In the first year, we will scale to over 58,000 members. This phase is designed to multiply generosity and expand the reach of the program’s mission to underserved communities globally.
            </p>

            <h4>Phase 4: Global Penetration</h4>
            <p>
                By Year 2, the program targets a 17% penetration across all demographics, with over 183,000 members. This phase is marked by exponential growth, creating a worldwide ripple effect of generosity.
